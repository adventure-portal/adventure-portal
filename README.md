# Developers Guide

* To begin working on Adventure Portal, [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) must be installed on your machine. 
* Create a directory to hold the project
* Clone the project to your machine with:
```
git clone https://github.com/adventure-portal/adventure-portal.git
```
* cd into the app/ directory and install libraries with:
```
meteor npm install
```
* Run the application with:
```

```
* Test that Adventure Portal is running on localhost:3000 from any browser. If you have an account on the UH test CAS server, you can login. Note: It may take some time to build the project and start up the application after running the commands.

From here, you can use the editor of your choice to begin modifying Adventure Portal's files. Note that Adventure Portal uses the coding style preferences described by this xml [file](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/development-environments/ics-se-code-style.xml). To get an idea of the project structure, it is helpful to note that Adventure Portal is based on the meteor-application-template available [here](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/).
